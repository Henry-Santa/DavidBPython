Are you tinkering with your code until it comes out
right?

Or are you modeling your code in your own head?

"Modeling" means saying what you think is happening
after every statement - what is the value of every
object after every line.

If you can't model your code, you aren't really coding

If you don't test *every* *line* of your code, you
aren't really coding.
